Google thinks you said: here are some weaknesses I suggest the authors to include a brief discussion of TPU for example what it can be done and what I cannot be done efficiently to experimental evaluation is a bit problematic as well how about other methods on gpus gpus like hashing and graph-based methods beside the f a i s s Baseline and a figure 3 the highest recall shown for glove is 0.9 is there a recall limitation for the proposed algorithm and finally the technical contribution of the by stage partial reduction and scoring is limited

Please enter your question: can provide me a summary of the reviewer?
Number of requested results 4 is greater than number of elements in index 1, updating n_results = 1
Answer: The reviewer gave a summary of the paper, highlighting its presentation of an algorithm on TPU and analysis of memory and instruction bandwidth for a specific set of algorithms. They noted strengths such as the well-motivated problem, comprehensive discussion of related work, and easy-to-follow story. However, they also pointed out weaknesses, including the need for a brief discussion of TPU capabilities, problematic experimental evaluation, and limitations in technical contributions. The reviewer overall provided a balanced assessment of the paper, acknowledging both its strengths and areas for improvement.
